      <div class="article-content">
        <p>We all have things in our life that we know can be better. It is the impact these have and our ability to act upon them based on our current mindset which determine the path we take. When the idea of making a change is more enticing than the reasons why we shouldn't, this is the time to act. Change happens predominantly on the two main extremities of emotions:

        <p><b>1. Pain -</b> where something bad has happened (or inevitably about to) that forces us to change our ways - e.g. an overdose that forces a drug user to stop their addiction</p>
        
        <p><b>2. Pleasure -</b> when you are happy (or the premise of happiness/pleasure is near) associated with a particular change - e.g. you just had your first child and want to lose weight so you can be a more active parent.</p>
        
        These two main emotions (and all the grey areas in between) are what form our mindset in relation to change. This mindset is an interplay between the conscious and subconscious parts of our mind. For change to be initiated subconsciously, we must first have conscious awareness of whether we are applying this change from pain, pleasure or another reason. Once we set a clear and defined objective and reasoning, the subconscious will then become congruent to give the journey direction, purpose and outcome, most importantly at a more autonomous level. In saying this you don't necessarily have to be in extreme pain or pleasure modes to change something, rather identify the perspective, reasons and emotions you are attaching to making that change for best results.</p>

      <h2 class="article-title">The Top 5 Things Children Teach Parents</h2>

      <h4>1. Patience</h4>
    <div class="article-content">
      <p>As children are developing and learning new things it forces us as parents to be patient and allow them to grow. As behaviours are learnt, they experiment with a variety of them to test our tolerance. However, it’s important to take a step back and acknowledge that at the end of the day they are just being children.</p>
      <h4>2. Living in the Moment</h4>
       <p>As adults we can find ourselves deliberating about the past, or worrying about the future. This leaves very little time to focus on the present and just live in the moment. Our children are free from the stress and pressures that we as parents face. This allows them to simply enjoy every moment without  any worries.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
       
      <div class="article">
       <h4>3. Keeping It Real</h4>
       <div class="article-content">
       <p>As adults we have a tendency to complicate everything and over analyse things too much. Children on the other hand see things very clearly and have no filter so they say it as they see it. For example, they might point out an overweight person as being big. As adults we find this highly embarrassing for the person and also for ourselves. </p>
        <p><h4>4. Non-verbal Interpretation</h4>
        We are used to being able to speak to people to find out information or to find out how others are feeling. As our children learn verbal skills we become more attuned to their non-verbal communication. We learn what they want through closely observing their body language, tones and facial expressions because if they are upset we inevitably want to make them happy.</p>
        <p><h4>5. More Effective Communication</h4>
        Communication is the key to successful relationships. A significant lesson we learn from children is not to overcomplicate how we speak. Asking straightforward questions can lead to getting the answers you want. They teach us how to approach people if we need them to do something for us and how to effectively achieve this. </p>

        <p class="article-content">If you are experiencing a dark and troublesome time in your life and feel there is no way out, the steps below (if carried out methodically without compromise) will help you identify, feel better and move beyond the issues causing this. Whether the consequences of your actions caused you to break down your relationship, lose your job, destroy your friendships or generally created what seems to be an 'un-fixable' situation in your life, following the steps below will help you how to feel better.</p>
        <p>It’s easy for others to recognize that there is something wrong, but the first step for you is to admit it yourself. Your feelings greatly impact the way you behave, and feelings of hurt and pain will manifest in different ways. People are often swayed by how their heart feels which can stop rational and objective thoughts. </p>
        <p>When you recognize that you had a part to play in your current predicament you may feel frustrated or even angry with yourself for letting it happen. Part of this anger is from knowing that you knew better and could have prevented yourself from getting to this stage. Don’t let this anger turn into self-loathing because it will consume you in a negative way.</p>

        <div class="article-content">
        <p>We all need to be reminded once in a while that we have our own goals and desires we wish to achieve. We must set these goals & desires, and go after them if we truly want them to become our reality. That distant mountain is not meant just to be looked at, but for us to climb to the top.

            It is important for us to get conscious to our own desires, to really know that we want something, not that we'll just live day to day and wonder why it hasn't happened. Our brains are constantly thinking, running through images and phrases and all sorts of chaotic mess while we're at work, school or anywhere.
            
            What YOU need to do is get aware of what you are thinking, snap out of the bad ones, and focus on what you really want. But don't just think about it once, you may be surprised with how your life will change with a bit of practice!</p>

        <div class="article-content">
        <p>Our lives are the result of countless thoughts, experiences and memories. How we react to each and every circumstance we encounter in life is dependent on many factors. In this article I want to share the importance of associations and attachments to things we experience, and how they greatly affect our life's direction.</p>
        <p>The mind works off many points in time – past, present and future. It uses the past as a reference point based upon things that have happened previously and how we feel about them. This is ultimately based on the way we question experiences and the attachment we place upon them. In the present when we are faced with a certain situation, we flick back through other similar experiences using these reference points, which in turn help create the outcome we choose in the present. Therefore it is important to be aware that the attachment we give to things will ultimately play a large role in the outcomes we create in the future.</p>
        <p>Attachments comes in varying degrees, ranging from “nothing” to the “extreme”. When we have 'extreme' or 'nothing' attachments, these will both will control our lives and stop us living our true self. When you view a situation and experience it in a neutral manner, you are in the 'meditation mode' of the mind so to speak. This is the 'reflective side', which is the proper way to use what is called the 'negative side'. This is to the best way to find faults, free from judgement and completely detached, in order to find the solution. Doing this you can act upon the situation, giving yourself a new direction and or a plan of attack for the outcome required with a new purpose.</p>

        <h2 class="article-title">The Difference Between Laziness, Procrastination & Lack of Motivation</h2>
        <div class="content-image">
        <img src="https://www.mindmotivations.com/sites/default/files/styles/news_full/public/images/articles/lazy-man.jpg?itok=7EO7KAFE" alt="image">
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-content">
        <p>I believe many people get laziness & procrastination confused with 'lack of motivation'. In my opinion all these behaviors are inter-connected at a deeper level emotionally and mentally. I believe they occur when there is a disconnection within one element of 'you'. Let me expand upon this statement in regards to human characteristics...</p>
        <h4>Different Aspects of Our Psychehe</h4> 
        <p>There are many parts to us all. These parts are what makes us who we are based on our experiences, our associations to these experiences, what importance they play in our lives, our understanding of them, and whether we have accepted them to be true. All of these factors combined create our opinions, points of view, beliefs and perceptions. In turn this creates our conscious circumstance which is basically the result of millions of pieces of data in the subconscious which molds who we are.</p>
        <h4>Lack of Motivation – Lack of Passion</h4>
        Looking at all these parts of our self, a lack of motivation is essentially connected to a lack of passion. Passion is something that inspires us towards a goal or vision which we look forward to achieving or having in our life. This fuels the search for self-satisfaction. However, when we have been picked on, put down, always told what to do, and not living up to expectations of others etc., we begin to lose passion for whatever we are doing. 
        <h4>Procrastination – Fear Within the Decision Making Processes</h4>
        <p>Procrastination is connected our decision making process. This is attached to a fear of making the wrong decision which has consequences like not meeting the expectations of others or ourselves. From this stems our belief systems which are formed over time and attached to future decision processes. Procrastination I believe is simply the result of fear which clouds our decision making to the point where we fail to take action and hence procrastinate on things. </p>
